# Behavior-Driven-Development

This is the repo for the Squish Behavior-Driven-Development course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started

The files provided are the test suites and the demo apps used with the tests. They provide a reference for the workflows covered in the course section.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Squish for Qt installed from the qt.io website. We Recommend using the Squish IDE in order to follow along with the content in the videos.
